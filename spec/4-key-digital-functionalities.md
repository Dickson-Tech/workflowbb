# 4 Key Digital Functionalities

The Workflow Building Block (WFBB) enables the creation and automatic execution
of business processes. Any application used to implement the WFBB specification
must provide the following key digital functionalities.

## 4.1 Workflow Process Building

WFBB candidates must allow business users to create arbitrary workflow
processes.

These processes must be able to perform calculations, make API requests (e.g.
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, HTTPS) make HTTP requests, and execute
scripts.

## 4.2 Workflow Process Execution

WFBB candidates (to differentiate themselves from mere business-process
_modelling_ tools) must be able to execute workflow processes:

1. via web API,
2. via manual interaction (click to run),
3. or via the passage of time.

## 4.3 Status Monitoring

WFBB candidates must allow business users to monitor the status of process
instances.

## 4.4 Programmatic Process Discovery

WFBB candidates must provide an API which allows another application or
developer to find a list of all available workflow processes for a given project
or workspace.
