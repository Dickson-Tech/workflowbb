# 4 Key Digital Functionalities

The WFbb enables the creation and automatic execution of business processes. Any application that is used to implement the WFbb must:

1. Allow business users to define and create arbitrary workflow processes
   1. that can be instantiated via API, manual interaction, or via the passage of time
   2. that can perform calculations, make API requests (e.g. HTTPS) make HTTP requests, and execute scripts
2. Allow business users to monitor the status of process instances
3. Allow other applications to discover existing processes via API

If a candidate application/implementation does these things, it may make for a suitable WFbb implementation.
