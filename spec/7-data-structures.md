# 7 Data Structures

## 7.1 Resource Model

The full resource model is described in detail in the [API Specification](../api/swagger.yaml), but the following is a high-level diagram of the key entities.

## 7.2 Data Elements

The data elements listed below provide detail for the resource model defined by the swagger specification. This section lists the required fields for each resource. The data elements listed are extensible in order to respond to specific use cases, however, the data elements listed below are a minimum requirement.

### 7.2.1 Process

**Description:** Represents a process that has been successfully created in a Workflow engine. This object contains important reference details like the generated process UUID (universally unique identifier), which is required to perform further operations on the process.
