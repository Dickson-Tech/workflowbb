# 7 Data Structures

## 7.1 Resource Model

The full resource model is described in detail in the
[API Specification](../api/swagger.yaml), but the following is a high-level
diagram of the key entities.

## 7.2 Data Elements

The data elements listed below provide detail for the resource model defined by
the swagger specification. This section lists the required fields for each
resource. The data elements listed are extensible in order to respond to
specific use cases, however, the data elements listed below are a minimum
requirement.

### 7.2.1 Process

Description: Represents a process that has been successfully created in a
Workflow engine. This object contains important reference details like the
generated process UUID (universally unique identifier), which is required to
perform further operations on the process.

### 7.2.2 ProcessDefinition

required to create a new process for a workflow engine.
