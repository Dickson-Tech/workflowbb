high-level requirements of the WFbb, not to specify certain design elements or

1. Link to architecture requirements document (and specific sections within that
   document, such as cross-functional requirements, general recommendations)
2. Link to use cases document â€“ this document may be a valuable resource while
   developing workflows to ensure that a variety of different use cases are
   covered by the building block definition.
3. Link to BB criteria and maturity metrics document created by Tanvir
4. Link to Low Resource Settings document
5. Link to GitHub repository and OpenAPI documentation site for the building
   blocks.
