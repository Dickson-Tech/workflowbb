# 9 Internal Workflows

The workflows required for this Building Block are outlined in detail under the “[User Journeys and Use Cases](9-workflows.md#user-journeys-and-use-cases)” section below.

Generally, however, the major workflow that is supported by this Building Block is that another Building Block or application will request to start an instance of a process by calling an API. There will be an immediate response to that request, indicating that either the process has started or, in the unlikely event that the process is to be completed synchronously, that the process has finished. If synchronous, the response to the initial request will be the output of the process.

## User Journeys and Use Cases

The WFbb is present in multiple use cases. Use cases can be found in the [logical process blueprint](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DRjpuyINjf6YVBRrEh9Q6VdB0zVzq1aqGQOukpktWZ8/edit#heading=h.f0ewpzm6b55p) and a subset of those that we focus on below can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JYdcmeUhJrwl7TfSuVtBJ9a0C335VbRg). These user journeys and use cases have been referenced by the authors of the specification to ensure that the functional requirements for the spec suit the needs of the proposed implementations.
